We welcome everybody, so if you want to help us, contact us by email (see down there)

## What .... ?
Calc & Stats is a formula solver for **Calculus** and **Statistics** on TI-Nspire. Enter known values and solve for unknowns across limits, derivatives, integrals, descriptive statistics, probability, distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression.
 
The only requirement to run the .tns files is to have an Nspire OS >= 3.0. You can find the latest updates [here](http://education.ti.com). Version 3.9 is preferred to enjoy the latest features, and 3.1/3.6 if you want to keep Ndless.

## Formula categories
- **Calculus**: Limits, Derivatives (power, exp, log, curvature), Integrals (power, exponential, trapezoidal), Applications (sphere, cylinder, cone, related rates)
- **Statistics**: Descriptive stats, Probability, Distributions (z, t, binomial, Poisson), Confidence intervals, Hypothesis tests, Regression, Two-sample tests
